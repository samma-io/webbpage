# Me 
I'm Mattias and have worked in IT for a long time. First computer IBM x286 with their WebOS. Well, I was able to open it up and remove a ROM. And then I could install windows95.

## Unwilling end up in Sec
I started working at a payment company and during the first weeks 

```Did you read IT-Security at University? We have this PCI DSS coming up if you can have a look ```

From that day on for many years, I have worked on securing our PCI DSS system. 

## Time make you think
In the beginning, it was more of a case of "this is important, and let's create a block here and make a checkbox of an approval" etc, etc. However, over time I favoured security that is more proactive, allowing monitoring, alerting when necessary and then reactive when it's needed.
So instead of bringing up a hard wall and putting all energy building that wall with a firewall, I prefered installing tools that would look over the apps and react when it sees a change. For example, a new outgoing request to a new endpoint would trigger an alert for me.

## Scanners
I had the same issues with the scanner and I remember one day when a talked with some security professional that urged that we had DELETE options open on our REST endpoint and that was a problem because you can delete files from the server with that.
I said that well we have PUT and GET also open and then started thinking there must be a better way ...

## Samma
Samma is not a replacement for big scanners but can be good start scannings your apps. And with that finding security problems early and fixing them early.
