      <description>You probably doing it wrong Why do people always scan the prod site with security scanners? For me, it does not make much sense. I understand in the old days when your prod and int environments were completely different and you could run one version of apache in one place and one completely different in prod.
If that is the case for you today then fixing that is your main task.</description>
