      <description>How a scanner is working This will explain how a samma scanner is working.
Start the scanner The first part of the scanner is a wrapper that starts the scan. These are on some scanner a python scripts that read the ENV values in the docker. And then wraps the scanner commands after these settings.
this is one of the commands that start the Nmap scanner
process = subprocess.Popen(&#39;sudo /bin/nmap -sV --script http-enum {0} -oX /out/result.</description>

      <description>First page Why I started samma scanner. The scanners I worked with were far away from the developer. They were run on some external server and you could &amp;ldquo;Schedule a scan&amp;rdquo; that was started when there was space on the scanner server.
I did see a problem with this a wanted scanners to be
Light I wanted the scanner to be light runs fast and can be run anywhere from a scanner engine but also from a developer laptop.</description>

      <description>How I use the samma scanners to do recon when pentesting I was tasked to do a first pentest against an AWS-hosted environment. This was an automated test to run before a more advanced pentest was planned. And the goal was to do a quick scan of the assets to catch any low-fruits targets and then be able to resolve them before the larger pentest was conducted.
The setup To use as a base for the scanners a deployed a minikube Kubernetes on my local desktop.</description>

 char[] value int[] offset int count int hash  Subing.substring create a String by sharing the original String&amp;rsquo;s internal char[] value and setting offset. This saves memory and makes String.substring run in a constant time($O(1)$). Meanwhile, this feature may cause memory leak1.
